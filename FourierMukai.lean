  FourierMukai.lean
  Main entry point for the Fourier–Mukai formalization project.

  This file will state (and eventually prove) the Fourier–Mukai equivalence theorem
  for the derived category of coherent sheaves on an elliptic curve over an algebraically closed field.

  TODO:
  - Define the abelian category of coherent sheaves on E, `Coh(E)`
  - Define the bounded derived category, `D^b(Coh(E))`
  - Define the Poincaré bundle on E × E
  - State and prove the Fourier–Mukai equivalence theorem
