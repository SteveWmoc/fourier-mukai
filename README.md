This project aims to formalize the **Fourierâ€“Mukai transform** â€” a fundamental equivalence in derived algebraic geometry â€” in Lean 4 using [mathlib4](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4). It represents the first step in a broader plan to explore aspects of the **Geometric Langlands Program** in a formalized, verifiable way.

## What is the Fourier-Mukai Transform?

The Fourier-Mukai transform is a powerful tool in algebraic geometry that generalizes the classical Fourier transform to the setting of algebraic varieties. Given two smooth projective varieties X and Y, and a "kernel" object P on their product X Ã— Y, the transform creates an equivalence between the derived categories of coherent sheaves on X and Y.

**Key Applications:**
- Provides equivalences between derived categories of different varieties
- Essential tool in mirror symmetry and string theory
- Fundamental in understanding moduli spaces and their geometry
- Critical component of the Geometric Langlands correspondence

## Mathematical Prerequisites

This formalization assumes familiarity with:
- Algebraic geometry (schemes, sheaves, coherent sheaves)
- Homological algebra and derived categories
- Category theory and functors
- Basic knowledge of the Langlands program (for advanced goals)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
- [elan](https://leanprover-community.github.io/get_started.html) (Lean version manager)
- [lake](https://github.com/leanprover/lake) (Lean 4 build system)
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SteveWmoc/fourier-mukai.git
cd fourier-mukai
```

2. Fetch dependencies and build:
```bash
lake exe cache get  # Download mathlib4 cache (recommended)
lake build          # Build the project
```

3. Update mathlib4 (when needed):
```bash
lake update
```

### Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

- **Build errors**: Try `lake clean` followed by `lake build`
- **Dependency issues**: Run `lake update` to get latest mathlib4
- **Cache problems**: Use `lake exe cache get!` to force re-download
- **VS Code setup**: Install the Lean 4 extension and ensure elan is in your PATH

**Getting Help:**
- Check the [Lean 4 manual](https://leanprover.github.io/lean4/doc/)
- Ask questions on [Lean Zulip](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/) in #mathlib4 or #new members
- Open an issue in this repository

## Usage Examples

```lean
-- Example: Working with line bundles on projective space
import FourierMukai.LineBundles

-- Define O(1) on P^1
example : LineBundleOnP1 := O_1

-- Example: Basic Fourier-Mukai setup (planned)
import FourierMukai.IntegralTransform

-- Define a Fourier-Mukai transform with kernel P
-- example (X Y : Scheme) (P : KernelObject X Y) : 
--   FourierMukaiTransform P : D(X) â¥¤ D(Y) := sorry
```
